# snapspam
SnapSpam lets you spam report a Snapchat user in hopes of getting them banned. 

It requires an API key from ImageTyperz in order to solve the Captchas, but you can easily patch in your own API if you're not a fan of that service. It also requires a list of emails in order to file the reports. 

This tool is not guaranteed to result in a ban, however, I've found that if someone posts questionable content that breaks the ToS, or has been placed on a Snapchat timeout in the past, then they'll probably be banned. The only time this tool hasn't worked for me was when I tried to delete innocent accounts, people who break the ToS were gone by the next morning.
